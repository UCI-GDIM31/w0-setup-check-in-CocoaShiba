# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [x] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I'm hoping to learn the "proper" way of coding games in order to ensure that the game runs as best as possible. I do have personal experience coding games, but since I have never officially learned programming for games in a class setting, there are a few areas I could improve upon.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
Since I have prior coding experience, I'm not too worried about completing assignments. If anything, I'm nervous about working in group projects since I tend to struggle with effective communication between other classmates.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
I know C++, GDScript, and have a bit of experience with Java/Javascript. 

2. Game development (any engine)
I have been developing a game in Godot since this April, so I am most comfortable in Godot. I have a tiny bit of experience with Game Maker Studio 2.

3. Unity
I have helped friends code games in Unity, but I have no experience with it myself.

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
NA

2. Scope management
Keeping a game within the bounds of what can reasonably be completed depending on the amount of people working on the game, how experienced the team is, and how much of a budget you have.

3. Iteration
Repeating a section of code a set amount of times, a varied amount of times, or until a certain condition is met.

4. Object-Oriented programming
Certain programming languages that use "objects" as a way to efficiently store and manipulate data. Objects contain a set of custom methods and properties, and are created by defining a class or struct.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
NA
